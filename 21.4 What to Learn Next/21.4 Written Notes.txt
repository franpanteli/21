-> Once you've completed Flask, it's time to explore new areas to expand your skill set
	-> There are multiple directions you can go in, depending on your interests and career goals

-> What To Learn Next:
	-> More Back-End Development with Django
		-> Django is another popular Python web framework, offering a different approach to web development
		-> It is considered a "boilerplate" framework, meaning it comes with a lot of built-in features ("batteries included")
		-> Django is ideal for complex projects that need to be built quickly
		-> While Django is less flexible than Flask, it is very useful for rapid development
		-> Learning Django is a logical next step if you're serious about web development with Python

	-> Front-End Web Development with JavaScript
		-> JavaScript is essential for front-end development and is widely used to create dynamic user interfaces
		-> Learning JavaScript can help you become a full-stack developer by complementing your Flask back-end skills
		-> Improving the front-end of your projects will give you more control over the entire development process
		-> Consider the CodingNomads JavaScript 101 Course to enhance your JavaScript skills

	-> Data Science & Machine Learning
		-> Flask can be used as a back-end framework for data science applications, making it a good foundation for AI-related projects
		-> Learn to present data science and machine learning models as web applications using Flask
		-> Consider diving into courses related to Data Science & Machine Learning to expand your expertise

	-> Job Preparation
		-> If you're looking to start a career or freelance as a Flask developer, focus on building your professional profile
		-> Consider career coaching to help you make informed decisions and prepare for the job market
		-> Building a strong portfolio and resume is essential to landing a job or contracting work as a software developer
		-> Stay engaged in the community and keep learning to enhance your employability
